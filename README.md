This repository documents the **IAM Lifecycle process** which is key for Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) systems like **SailPoint IIQ**.  

---

## 📌 Overview  

Identity Lifecycle Management ensures that:  
- ✅ New employees (**Joiners**) get the right access when they join  
- 🔄 Employees changing departments (**Movers**) have their access updated  
- ❌ Employees leaving the company (**Leavers**) have their access revoked

## 🎯 Why This Matters  

- Improves **security posture** by preventing orphan accounts  
- Ensures **least privilege access** (only what is needed)  
- Reduces **manual errors** with automation (SailPoint, AD)  
- Supports **compliance requirements** (SOX, GDPR, ISO 27001)
